# Office Seat Booking Bot

## Overview
This bot was created to solve a problem I noticed during my internship at Click. The office had more employees than available seating, which led to people manually reserving their spots. To streamline this process, I developed an automated solution using Java to allow employees to book seats efficiently.

## Features
- Allows users to book a seat in the office.
- Ensures fair allocation of available seating.
- Prevents double booking.
- Provides a simple and efficient booking process.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** - Core development language
- **Spring Boot**
- **Database** - PostgreSQL

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Acer-Samsung/Workspace-Haven.git)
   cd Workspace-Haven
   ```
2. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
- Users can access the bot via Telegram
- They can check available seats and book one.
- Admins can manage seat reservations.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate a real-time notification system.
- Add user authentication and role management.
- Improve the UI.
